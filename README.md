## Setup

Clone or download this repo.

```bash
# cd to vue-feathers-productivity repo directory
$ cd [path/to/vue-feathers-productivity]
# install node_modules in server directory
$ cd server
$ npm install
# install node_modules in client directory
$ cd ../client
$ npm install
```

**_Note_**: _You may receive vulnerability warnings. They are in 'cli-plugin-e2e-nightwatch', an e2e test utility. Thus they do no impact the normal usage of either server or client. Run `npm audit fix` to fix them, or `npm audit` for details. (As of 11/08/2018 no fix is yet available)_

## Development Usage

**In Git Bash window #1 - run server**:

```bash
# cd to vue-feathers-productivity repo directory
$ cd [path/to/vue-feathers-productivity]
$ cd server
# copy dummy data as a starting point
# 4 users: test1, test2, test3 and test4. Password equals username
$ npm run setup:dev
# start the server
$ npm run dev
```

You should see a generic Feathers page at <http://localhost:3030/>.

**In Git Bash window #2 - run client**:

```bash
# cd to vue-feathers-productivity repo directory
$ cd [path/to/vue-feathers-productivity]
$ cd client
# start the server (hot-reload enabled)
$ npm run dev
```

You can view the client app at <http://localhost:8289/> (local) or <http://192.168.56.1:8289/> (network).
